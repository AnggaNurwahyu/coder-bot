# Qwen Coder
A Code Helper Discord Bot
based on: Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct

This is my first time creating a Discord bot please go easy on me.
it's currently still in early development

### Prerequisites
- Discord APP TOKEN (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Huggingface API or Access Tokens to use the Huggingface AI Model (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
- Anything in requirements.txt

### To Do list:
- Fix the code Structure
- Implementing another AI Agent
- Change the Bot from Code Helper into multimodal Bot (idk if i can possibly do this lol)
- Use containers like Docker for example
- Make the bot can read a code files from Discord chat

# Usage
- First of all, you need 2 things. Discord APP tokens and your huggingface access Tokens
- put the Tokens in .env
- Run the code and bot will connect to the discord API
- Invite the bot into your Discord Server or something
- Done

### BRUH
This things sometimes broke I'll fix it later
